          It is RentCar's policy to respect your privacy regarding any

          Policy applies to www.rentcar.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
          "www.rentcar.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
          protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us
          through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
          Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website,

          Like most website operators, RentCar collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. RentCar's purpose in collecting non-personally
          identifying information is to better understand how RentCar's visitors
          use its website. From time to time, RentCar may release
          non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
          publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

          Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Certain visitors to RentCar's websites choose to interact with RentCar
          in ways that require RentCar to gather personally-identifying
          information. The amount and type of information that RentCar gathers
          depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
          who sign up for a blog at http://www.rentcar.com to provide a username
          and email address.

          The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
          remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
          of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we
